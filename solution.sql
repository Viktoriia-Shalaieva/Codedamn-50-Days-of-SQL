Calculating Admission Costs Based on Insurance Status in a Hospital Database

In this lab, you will be working with a database containing a table called admissions. Your task is to calculate the total cost of admissions for patients based on their insurance status.

Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance and $10 for patients with insurance. You can determine if a patient has insurance based on their patient_id; all patients with an even patient_id have insurance.

You are required to write a SQL query that does two things:

Label each patient with 'Yes' if they have insurance and 'No' if they don't.
Calculate the total admission cost for each group (Yes and No). Make sure to only use Yes and No strings as labels to pass the tests.
Make sure to set the column names to has_insurance and cost_after_insurance in the sql query to pass the tests
Concepts Required
Conditional Logic: Use of the CASE statement to apply conditions.
Aggregation: Using SUM to calculate total costs.
Grouping Records: Usage of GROUP BY to segregate data into groups.
Your output should include two columns: one that states if the patient has insurance ('Yes' or 'No') and another that gives the total admission cost for that group.

Here's how the final output should like with different integer values, make sure that the column names and the string values match with the table

has_insurance	cost_after_insurance
No	123123
Yes	123123
*/

Aggregating Admissions Attended by Each Doctor
You are provided with a database that contains multiple tables. Your task is to write a SQL query to fetch specific information from two tables: admissions and doctors.

Question:
Show first_name, last_name, and the total number of admissions attended for each doctor. Note that every admission in our database has been attended by a doctor.

Important Concepts:
JOIN: This SQL command can be used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. For this lab, you will need to understand how to use JOIN to fetch data from both admissions and doctors tables.

GROUP BY: This clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like "find the number of admissions for each doctor". It's often used with aggregate functions like COUNT(), MAX(), etc.

COUNT(): An aggregate function that returns the number of items in a group.

Requirements:
Ensure you select the correct columns in the order specified in the question.
You'll need to use the JOIN operation to combine information from both tables.
Make sure to aggregate your results properly to display the total number of admissions for each doctor.
Make sure the name of the columns in output are: first_name, last_name, admissions_total

DAY 39 
Analyzing Daily Hospital Admissions and Their Variations

For each day, compute the total number of admissions. Additionally, calculate the difference in the number of admissions from the previous day.

Concepts to understand:
Aggregate Functions: These are SQL functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Examples include SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), etc.

Window Functions: These are special SQL functions that perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. An example in this exercise would be LAG(), which can fetch data from a previous row.

Your goal is to write an SQL query that accomplishes the given task. Remember, focus on the structure of your query, the use of aggregate functions, and the application of window functions where necessary. Good luck!

SELECT
    admission_date
    , COUNT(patient_id) AS admission_day
    , COUNT(patient_id) - LAG(COUNT(patient_id)) 
        OVER (ORDER BY admission_date) AS admission_count_change

Merging Customer and Supplier Data with Table Origin Column

You have access to two tables: customers and suppliers. Your objective is to:

Select the columns city, company_name, and contact_name from both tables.
Merge the results together.
Add an additional column in the result set to specify the origin of each record. This column should contain either 'customers' or 'suppliers' to indicate from which table the record came. Make sure name of this column is relationship
Concepts to Consider
Think about how you can merge results from two separate queries.
Consider how to add static values to a result set for classification purposes.
Ensure your final query is structured and formatted correctly. Once you believe you have the correct solution, submit your query for validation. Best of luck!
