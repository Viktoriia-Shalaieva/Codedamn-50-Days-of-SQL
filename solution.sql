Key Concepts
SQLite: A C-language library that provides a lightweight disk-based database. It doesnâ€™t require a separate server process.
SQL SELECT Statement: Used to select data from a database and fetch the result table. The result can be stored in a table or used as it is.
SQL WHERE Clause: Used to filter the results and extract only the necessary records.
BETWEEN Operator: In SQL, the BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set based on a range. It can be used with numbers, text and even dates.

DAY 11
In this lab, you'll be working with the Chinook database, which simulates a digital media store. You'll be tasked with a series of SQL challenges that will test your ability to retrieve, manipulate, and structure data effectively.

Dataset
The primary dataset you'll be working with is the Chinook database. It has various tables including Track, Album, Artist, and many others. Here's a brief overview:

"Track": Contains details about individual music tracks including their Name, duration (Milliseconds), and which Album they belong to (AlbumId).
"Album": Stores information about music albums including their Title and which Artist made them (ArtistId).
... (Other tables follow a similar descriptive format.)
Ensure that you use exact table names and column names as defined in the schema, and always use double quotes around them for clarity.

For each challenge, make sure to read the problem statement carefully and craft your SQL queries accordingly. Always ensure the columns in your output match the expected column names exactly, as discrepancies can lead to failed evaluations.

Task
You are required to retrieve track names ("Name") and their corresponding album IDs ("AlbumId") for tracks that have a duration longer than 5 minutes.

Conditions:

Use the "Track" table.
Filter by track duration ("Milliseconds") to get tracks longer than 300,000 milliseconds (5 minutes).
Order your result by the track name ("Name") in ascending order.
Your output should have columns named "Name" and "AlbumId".

Submission
Once you've crafted your SQL queries, you can submit them for evaluation. Remember to always check the expected output format and ensure your queries match them closely to maximize your chances of passing the challenges.

Best of luck!

Identifying Duplicate Patient Records by First and Last Names

Welcome to this SQL lab where you'll be working with a database named hospital.sqlite. This database contains a table named patients that, as you might guess, holds data related to patients. Your task is to delve into this data and extract valuable insights.

Objective:

Write an SQL query to display the number of duplicate patients based on their first_name and last_name.

Concepts to Understand:

GROUP BY Clause: This allows you to arrange identical data into groups. For this lab, you'll be grouping based on two columns: first_name and last_name.

HAVING Clause: Works in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to filter the grouped records based on a condition. You'll be using this to ensure you're only considering duplicate records.

Get started and try to come up with the solution on your own! Remember to focus on the task at hand and leverage the power of SQL's aggregation and filtering capabilities.

Make sure the column names are first_name, last_name, num_of_duplicates

Your main task in this lab is to craft SQL queries to extract specific data from the Chinook database. You should be able to understand the database schema, apply various SQL techniques, and come up with the required solution.

Database Schema
Here's a brief rundown of the tables and columns you will be working with:

"Artist": Contains "ArtistId" and "Name" columns.
"Album": Important columns include "AlbumId", "Title", and "ArtistId".
"Track": Some key columns are "TrackId", "Name", "AlbumId", and "InvoiceDate".
"Invoice": The main columns to note are "InvoiceId", and "InvoiceDate".
Instructions
Stick to the SQLite syntax as we are working with the SQLite version of the Chinook database.
Ensure your queries are optimized for performance.
Properly format and structure your SQL for readability.
Always include an "ORDER BY" clause where specified to ensure consistent and correct output.
Challenge
Objective: Your task is to count the number of invoices generated each year from the Invoice table.
