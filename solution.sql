Key Concepts
SQLite: A C-language library that provides a lightweight disk-based database. It doesnâ€™t require a separate server process.
SQL SELECT Statement: Used to select data from a database and fetch the result table. The result can be stored in a table or used as it is.
SQL WHERE Clause: Used to filter the results and extract only the necessary records.
BETWEEN Operator: In SQL, the BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set based on a range. It can be used with numbers, text and even dates.

select 
    first_name
    , last_name
from patients
where weight between 100 and 120

Filtering and Sorting Customer Data by City and Contact Name in SQLite
In this lab, you will be working with the SQLite database northwind.sqlite. Your main task is to construct an SQL query to retrieve specific information from the customers table.

Objective
Your SQL query should fulfill the following requirements:

Retrieve the city, company_name, and contact_name columns from the customers table.
Filter the records to only include rows where the city name contains the letter 'L'.
Sort the resulting data set by contact_name in ascending order.
Key Concepts
To complete this lab, you should be familiar with the following SQL operations:

SELECT for specifying the columns you want to retrieve
WHERE for filtering rows based on a condition
ORDER BY for sorting the results
*/
SELECT city, company_name, contact_name
FROM customers
WHERE city LIKE '%L%'
ORDER BY contact_name ASC

Concepts:
SELECT Statement: Used to select data from a database. The result is then stored in a result table.
Aggregate Functions: SQL aggregate functions return a single value, calculated from values in a column. The function MAX() is one such function which returns the maximum value of the selected column.
